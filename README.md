FlashCards app is in the form of a game where the round of questions asked to the user consists of 30 different questions, and will evaluate the users response to the question, provide feedback on whether it's correct or not, and report their results at the conclusion of the round.

Here we can see the game being started, followed by the user looking at the first questions provided and deciding on an answer.  We can see that they select the correct answer which results in the game providing them feedback on it being correct and then bringing up the next question.  We also see what it looks like when a user gets an answer wrong.
